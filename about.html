            </br>
			<p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">I am a Bachelor’s student in bioinformation technology at Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering. I took part in the Aaltonaut minor programme, which is Aalto University’s Bachelor’s Minor Programme on Interdisciplinary Product Development. I have a huge interest in the development of new medical and health-related technologies. </p>

            <h5 id="TWO"><b>Knowledge</b></h5>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><i>Aaltonaut is a melting pot of knowledge. Thanks to the professional teaching staff I have had the opportunity to learn a lot of different things, varying from business to materials. </i></p> 
            <span class="anchor" id="materials"></span>
            <div class="section">
            <h3><b>Materials</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Before Aaltonaut I knew a lot about materials from the theoretical point of view, how to e.g. evaluate a stress-strain graph for a specific material. In other words, I didn't know much about materials in practice. The Aaltonaut courses gave me knowledge about what kinds of materials are good for what purposes and how to identify unknown materials with the help of practical tests (e.g. scraping the surface). I have always been aware of the fact that some materials cause a huge impact on the environment, and I have tried my best to susbtitute these with materials that are more environmentally friendly. Today I know how to compare the impact of different materials objectively and make better material-related choices.</p></a>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><b>CES Edupack.</b> CES Edupack is a great tool for how to compare different materials (tensile strenght, water consumption, CO2-footprint). This is e.g. a great tool when comparing different materials in terms of sustainability and impacts on the environment.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><b>Life Cycle Assessment.</b> A Life Cycle Assessment is an evaluation of all the impacts caused by a product during its lifespan. Knowing how to evaluate the impacts and compare the impacts between different products will make it easier for me to in the future make more sustainable choices as a product developer.</p>

            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><b>Business models. </b>Having a basic knowledge of business is essential in all fields nowadays. Now when I understand better how companies work,  e.g. different strategies, organizational structures, branding and costumer analysis, I now see the world of business in a completely different light.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><b>Costumer Analysis. </b>There are no business without costumers, probably the main reason why the costumer analysis is a critical part of the business plan of any company. Identifying the costumer and understanding his/her needs, helps the business to understand what kind of a product might satisfy the needs of the costumers. The costumer analysis affects the marketing plan of the business, as different costumer profiles might help developing marketing plans that target a specific costumer group.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><b>Branding.</b> Brands are everywhere from the clothes we wear to the laptop I am using while writing this right now. We cannot hide from them, but we can understand how they work and make better shopping decisions next time. Branding is a powerful tool to master when it comes to starting a business, but can also lead to sinking the whole ship if used wrongly.</p>

            <h3><b>Basics of 3D printing/modeling</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Many people claim that 3D printing or additive manufacturing is the future in production, I don't contradict that after the Aaltonaut courses covering additive manufacturing. I now understand all the possibilities with 3D printing, but I am also aware of the limitations of the process. I now know the basics of making 3D models with different software and the basics about how to print the computer made models. </p>

            <h3><b>Basics of Electronics</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Even though I study at the School of Electrical Engineering I have not had the opportunity to take courses covering electronics in practice. During the Designing your Electronic Device for Business and Production course I learned how to go from an idea to a real electronic device. I learned about all the parts that have to be included and about all the properties of the device that have to be taken into account to make the device both functional and durable. I now undestand better how the electronics work in practice (not only as calculations on paper), and I also now know how to compile small electronic devices by myself. </p>

<h3><b>Making prototypes</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The Designing your Electronic Device for Business and Production also taught me the importance about prototypes. Many practical problems with our product during this course was solved by simple prototypes that e.g. illustrated the needed size of the shell for all the different electronic parts needed. I enjoy the prototyping fase because all doors are still open and you are allowed to try both good and bad (if not ridiculous) ideas without causing any mess. Examples of prototypes can be found in the <a href="courses.html">course section</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Communication, Pitching and Debates</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">
                The first thing that you learn (either in the easy or the hard way) is to <b>communicate</b> with your team mates. You learn how to communicate with people with different educational backgrounds and how to explain things without using the everyday terminology you use while discussing with people from your own field of study.</p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The Aaltonaut minor covered during multiple courses pitching and debate techniques. Knowing how to debate and how to argue in a convincing way is important in everyday life. Debates are a powerful tool used in the society of today that forces people to look at things from different angles. Pitching, i.e. Elevator speach, is important espacially while trying to find financial support of any kind. Making people understand what you are selling and why this is good for the person in question is a great skill. There are some guidelines for how to deliver a good speach, e.g. how to get the listener's attention, how to keep him/her interested and how to end the speach in you favor. My personal opinion is that the simpler the better, you don't need fancy powerpoint presentations or fancy lights pointing at you. The most important thing is the speaker's genuine enthusiasm and interest in the product, everything else (e.g. coming up with a good punch line at the end) only requires a little bit of effort.

        <div class="section"></div>
        <h3><b>Team Work</b></h3>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Aaltonaut courses are all about team work. One of the most important things you learn while working together in interdiciplinary teams is that <i>"the sum is greater than the parts".</i> The team members complement each other regarding knowledge and skills, which leads to much better results in the end. Recognizing each others strengths and weaknesses is a must to make sure the project proceeds smoothly and to ensure that all the team members feel appreciated for what they do.</p>
            <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">It is both easy and fun to work in teams with positive atmosphere, but a good atmosphere does not come easy. Everyone in the team have to participate to make it work. Now when I have worked in many different kinds of teams, both good and bad, I am more confident in how to <b>solve problematic situations</b> and what not to do when something in the team does not work as it should. You have to practice to become a good team player, and that kind of practice has Aaltonaut given me. You can never be fully learned in team working, you learn something new every time you step into a new team. 
             </p>
             <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">To ensure that the project is proceeding in the right direction it is essential that the work is equally divided among the team members and well <b>scheduled</b>. <b>Dividing the work</b> helps the team members to understand their part of the project and to make sure that no team member is loaded with more work than the others. <b>Holding the agreed deadlines</b> is a must if you want to be a good team player. As important is to communicate with your team and inform them if you are not capable of finishing a task given to you. To be <b>conscious of your own weaknessess</b> is as important as pinpointing your strengths and skills.
