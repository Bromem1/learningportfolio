    <h1>What is Aaltonaut?</h1>
      <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Aaltonaut is Aalto University’s Bachelor’s Minor Programme on Interdisciplinary Product Development.</p>
		</br>
			<h1 id="ONE">AAN-C2006 Product Analysis</h1>
      <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><i>An introductory course to interdiciplinary product development</i></p>
			</br>
			<p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">My Aaltonaut minor started with the course Product Analysis, which gives the student a hands-on introduction to the world of product development. The goal of the course is to help the students understand the basics of product development by analyzing the whole production process of an already existing product. </p>
      <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The students were divided into interdiciplinary teams of five. All the teams were given a product, in our case a CANON Pixma printer, to analyze during the course. The lectures covered a wide range of product analysis methods and prinicples, e.g. manufacturing processes and costumer analysis, and our task was to apply the lecture content to our own product. We started out figuring out who the possible costumers for the product could be, and what methods the company in question has used to reach out to their specific costumer groups. 
This followed by dismantling the actual product leading to an analysis of the manufacturing methods and the materials used. We also learned how to analyse and calculate the actual value of the product. </p>

     </figure>
   </br>
      <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><i>“I will never look at any product in the same way again”.</i> This was my exact thoughts when the Product Analysis course ended, even though I realised I had only scraped the surface of product development. The course was a great introduction to how different products are made and what materials are used for which kinds of purposes. 
The costumer and value analysis are great tools to handle in the future, but they have also both come in handy during other university courses and projects. 
The fact that we were divided into interdiciplinary and international groups, made us work on our communication and team working skills. Many confusing moments and problems were solved by communcation within the team and by taking all the team members’ study backgrounds and knowledge into account when dealing with a specific problem.

		<h1 id="TWO">AAN-C2003 ADD BASICS: Working in the Digital Paradigm </h1>
    <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><i>3D modeling and business models</i></p>
			</br>
			<p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The goal of the ADD basics course is for the students to come up with a business idea covering 3D printing. The course lectures covers the basics of additive manufacturing, materials used in 3D printing, CAD basics, business models and marketing plans. </p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The course started with brainstorming in teams of two about possible business ideas. We developed our idea further parallel to the lectures, and pitched about our business idea to the rest of the class during a small pitching session. Half of the teams were eliminated during the pitching competition, and the memebers of the eliminated teams were merged with still existing ones for the rest of the course. </p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">At the beginning of the course I had no experience about 3D printing, nor about 3D modelling, so the course gave me a lot of great learning opportunities. The business part of the course was extremely detailed, as it covered all the aspects of making a business plan and starting your own business.</p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The commucation within the teams played a very essential role during the brainstorming and ideation fases of the course. The fact that we were merged together in new teams after the pitching competition shows how important communication is, as different roles and responsibilites established in the old teams had to be changed to fit the new members. Communicating our idea was also an important aspect of the course, as the course also covered techniques for how to pitch ideas. Being able to explain your ideas in a understandable and interesting way is extremely important when it comes to selling products, and I am sure that knowing how to pitch ideas will come in handy in the future. </p>

		<h1 id="THREE">AAN-C2007 Product Sustainability</h1>
    <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><i>The life cycle of products and sustainable product development</i></p>
			</br>
			<p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The goal of the Product Sustainability course is to teach the students the impacts different product development decisions, e.g. materials or production location, have on the environment. </p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">All the teams were given a product that they had to work with during the whole course. My group got an umbrella and our task during the course was to analyze the existing umbrella, and based on our analysis design a more sustainable one. The Life Cycle Assessment report (LCA) played a great role during the course. In the LCA report we considered the different environmental impacts our new umbrella design has on the nature compared to the already existing one.

      </figcaption>
     </figure>
   </br>
    </p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The course also covered debate techniques, as the course ended in a debate about topics regarding sustainability. This was the first debate for me, so I really hade to walk out of my comfort zone this time. The course (especially the debate) made it clear for me that product sustainability is a very complex topic, there are no easy answers for all the questions regarding this subject. </p>

		<h1 id="FOUR">AAN-C2009 Designing an Electronic Device for Business and Production</h1>
    <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify"><i>Designing an electrical device from an idea to a production-ready plan</i></p>
			</br>
			<p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The course is the turning point of the Aaltonaut minor, as the students have now the possibility to develop their own product for the first time. The teams consist of students from different fields of study, which comes in handy when everything from the business model to designing the electronics have to be taken care of. The course consists of traditional lectures and themed workshops (e.g. a electronics and a 3D modeling workshop). </p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Our team desided to design a dust meter for industrial use. We started out by brainstorming about the features of the device and went on with designing the shape of the dust meter. Our goal for the course was to present a functional prototype of the product at the gallery walk at the end of the course. </p>

   </br></br>
      <p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">Our team consisted of great team players with knowledge of electronics, programming and 3D modeling. Our team work during the whole course worked smoothly, which I think was the main reason why our team won the gallery walk at the end of the course. </p><p style="font-size:19px;" class="justify">The course is perfect as a final course of the Aaltonaut minor, as it wraps up all that you have learned during the past two years. The course gives you the possibility to realise what you already know and what you have to work more on in the future.</p>
